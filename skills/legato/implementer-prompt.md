# Implementer Prompt Template

The one build seat. Dispatch **one** implementer, alone — the conductor never
plays in Legato, and no second writer ever shares the branch. Paste in
everything it needs; it never reads the scout's raw report and never hunts
for the request. Also used for a QC `[implementation]` blocker — then fill
the *Work already on the branch* section, which a first dispatch omits.

```
Agent tool (effort: xhigh):
  description: "Build motion: [short surface handle]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing an approved motion spec on one UI surface.
    Everything you need is below — do not go looking for a plan or a spec
    file; none exists, and that is by design.

    ## What to build

    [Brief: the restated request, verbatim]

    **Acceptance:** [the feel goal in words, plus anything mechanical]

    ## The approved motion spec

    [The direction the user locked at the gate, in full: each change as
    anchor · current → target, with the exact values — curves, durations,
    properties, spring configs, stagger steps. This is settled: build this,
    not a better idea you have along the way.]

    ## Where it lands

    [The scout's inventory rows for the touched surface: `file:line`
    anchors, current values, the project's motion conventions — token file,
    naming, exemplar — and the personality the motion must match.]

    ## Decisions already on the record (omit when none)

    [Rows from docs/repertoire/animation.md that constrain this work,
    verbatim. They are settled; do not contradict them.]

    ## The reference bar

    - [absolute path to skills/legato/references/STANDARDS.md]

    Read it before you write. When your implementation needs a value the
    spec does not state, take it from there — never approximate a value that
    file states exactly.

    ## Work already on the branch (omit this section on a first dispatch)

    [Only on a QC re-dispatch: the commit SHAs and what each covers · what
    is DONE and must not be rebuilt · what the blocker says is missing or
    wrong · what remains. Read those commits first and build the remainder
    on top; never restart from scratch.]

    Work from: [directory]   Branch: [BRANCH]
    Test command: [TEST — how to run the tests]

    Before you commit, confirm you are on the named branch. If you are not,
    stop and report NEEDS_CONTEXT rather than committing to the wrong branch.

    ## Craft rules that are not optional

    - **Animate `transform` and `opacity` only**; no `transition: all`, no
      layout properties, no Framer Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands where
      the motion runs under load — use the full transform string.
    - **Extend the project's motion tokens**; if a needed curve has no
      token, add one where the conventions say tokens live — never a fifth
      hand-typed cubic-bezier.
    - **Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`** wherever you add movement — gentler,
      not zero: keep the opacity and color feedback, drop the travel. Gate
      hover motion behind `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`.
    - **Interruptible where rapid** — transitions or springs that retarget
      from current state on anything triggered rapidly; keyframes only for
      motion that cannot be interrupted.
    - **Prefer the platform.** CSS transitions and `@starting-style` for
      predetermined motion; springs (or WAAPI) for dynamic, gesture-driven,
      interruptible motion. Reach for the project's existing motion library
      before adding any dependency — and add a new one only if the approved
      spec says so.

    ## Before you begin

    If anything about the spec or the acceptance is unclear, ask now.
    Raising a question is cheap; a guessed value is a review finding.

    ## Your job

    1. Build exactly the approved spec — nothing more (YAGNI). A surface the
       spec doesn't name is a surface you don't touch.
    2. Follow the conventions the landing section names; the change should
       look like the code around it.
    3. Keep or add tests where the project tests this kind of code, and run
       `[TEST]` scoped to what you touched. The full suite is not your job:
       the QC gate runs it once.
    4. **Commit your work** — clear messages, logical units. Commits are how
       the run resumes if interrupted.
    5. Self-review with fresh eyes — spec satisfied exactly? values exact?
       reduced motion handled? tokens extended, not duplicated? — fix what
       you find, then report.

    ## Report format (compact — the controller stays lean)

    Keep it under ~12 lines. No diffs, no pasted code.
    - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | NEEDS_CONTEXT | BLOCKED
    - What you built, in motion terms (a few lines)
    - Tests run/added and their result
    - Files changed and the commit SHA(s)
    - Any feel question you could not settle from code — name it explicitly;
      it goes to the reviewer and the user, never silently dropped.
```
